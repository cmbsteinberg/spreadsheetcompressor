# spreadsheetcompressor

This is an implementation of SpreadsheetCompressor from the paper [SpreadsheetLLM: Encoding Spreadsheets for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.09025v1). 

In a single class, it handles the reading in of most spreadsheet formats, and the conversion of the sheet into a reduced size markdown document, compressing information to reduce total tokens.
